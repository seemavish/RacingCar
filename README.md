# RacingCar
I have used moving car simulation program to simulate racing cars and have made the following changes to the code:
- changed numbers of gears and their top speeds
- information retrieval to get speed and gear
- included laps as a termination condition


Racing car program takes 4 cars and simulates a racing scenario.

The program has the following features:
- All cars start in gear 1 (speed initialized to 0).
- All cars shift to gear 5 in track 2 to speed up.
- Randomly choose cars to brake, then shift their gear and accelerate to speed up.
- There are 8 forward gears with different top speed limit for each gear. We are assuming all cars have the same number of gears and top speed limits.
- Each car takes 5 laps
